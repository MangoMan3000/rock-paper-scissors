# rock-paper-scissors

Rock, Paper, Scissors game from The Odin Project. 

The aim is to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game to be played in the console. I will come back to build a GUI that can be played in the browser. 

Key things to learn:
JS logic to run for loops
Linking a JS script to the index.html
Debugging, I am sure there will be many bugs
